If you want to download and install Battlefield 3 on your PC, you will need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the game files from a reliable source. You will need to download 35 parts of the game files, each with a .rar extension. For example, the first part is named Battlefield 3 Game Files.part01.rar, and the last part is named Battlefield 3 Game Files.part35.rar.
2. Extract the game files using a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will need to extract all the parts to the same folder. You should get a folder named Battlefield 3 with several subfolders and files inside.
3. Mount the ISO file using a software like Daemon Tools or PowerISO. You should see a virtual drive with the Battlefield 3 disc image.
4. Run the setup.exe file from the virtual drive and follow the instructions to install the game. You will need to enter a serial key when prompted. You can find a serial key online or use a key generator.
5. Copy the crack file from the Crack folder on the virtual drive and paste it to the installation folder of the game. This will overwrite the original file and allow you to play the game without a disc.
6. Enjoy playing Battlefield 3!
