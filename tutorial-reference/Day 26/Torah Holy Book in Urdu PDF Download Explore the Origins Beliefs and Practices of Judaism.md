The Torah is not only a historical record, but also a spiritual guide for Jews and Christians. It teaches us about God's character, His love, His justice, His mercy, His holiness, His faithfulness, His sovereignty and His plan. It also teaches us about our human nature, our need for repentance, our obedience, our faith, our worship, our morality and our purpose. It also points us to the Messiah, who is Jesus Christ, the Son of God and the fulfillment of the Torah.
