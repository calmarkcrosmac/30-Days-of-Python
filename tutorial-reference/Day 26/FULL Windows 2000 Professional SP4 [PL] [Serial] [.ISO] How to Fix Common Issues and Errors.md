Windows 2000 Professional ISO was the version intended for desktop use by professionals who needed a stable and secure system for their work. Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Advanced Server and Windows 2000 Datacenter Server were the versions aimed at server applications that required high performance, scalability and reliability. The Windows 2000 Datacenter Server was the last one to be developed and released to the public, and it had additional features for managing large-scale data centers with up to 32 processors and 64 GB of RAM.
  
Windows 2000 was based on the Windows NT kernel, which was more stable and secure than the Windows 9x series. It also introduced many new features and improvements, such as the Active Directory service, the Encrypting File System, the Windows Installer, the Windows Management Instrumentation and the Windows Driver Model. Windows 2000 also supported more hardware devices and standards, such as USB, IEEE 1394, ACPI and DVD.

Windows 2000 was well received by critics and users alike, who praised its performance, stability, security and compatibility. It was also widely adopted by businesses and organizations that needed a robust and reliable operating system for their servers and workstations. Windows 2000 was considered a success for Microsoft and a milestone in the history of Windows.
  
Windows 2000 was succeeded by Windows XP in 2001, which was based on the same kernel but had a more user-friendly interface and better multimedia capabilities. Windows XP also merged the consumer and professional lines of Windows, which were previously separated. Windows 2000 continued to receive support and updates from Microsoft until July 2010, when it reached its end of life.
