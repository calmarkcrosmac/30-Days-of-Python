However, despite its popularity and acclaim, the game has not received an official remake or remaster from EA. This has led some fans to take matters into their own hands and create their own mods that enhance the game's graphics and gameplay. One of these mods is the Samargil Remake, which was created by modgaming[^1^], a YouTube channel that showcases various mods for Need For Speed games.
 
The Samargil Remake is a fan-made mod that adds new cars and graphics to Need For Speed Underground 2. The mod features 29 new cars, ranging from classic muscle cars like the Dodge Charger R/T '1969 and the Shelby GT500 '1967, to modern supercars like the Bugatti Veyron and the Koenigsegg CCX. The mod also improves the game's graphics by adding new textures, lighting effects, reflections, shadows, and smoke effects. The mod also includes some new music tracks that fit the game's atmosphere.
 
The Samargil Remake is not an official remake or remaster of Need For Speed Underground 2, but rather a fan-made mod that requires the original game to run. The mod is not affiliated with EA or any of its subsidiaries. The mod is available for download on the modgaming website[^1^], where users can also find detailed instructions on how to install and use it. The mod is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10.
 
Need For Speed Underground 2 Samargil Remake is a mod that aims to bring new life and excitement to an old but beloved racing game. It is a testament to the creativity and passion of the Need For Speed fan community, who continue to support and enjoy the game even after almost two decades since its release.

- "I love this mod. It brings back so many memories."

However, the mod also has some limitations and drawbacks. For instance, the mod does not add any new tracks or locations to the game, nor does it change the gameplay mechanics or physics. The mod also does not support online multiplayer or cross-platform compatibility. The mod may also cause some performance issues or crashes on some systems, depending on the hardware specifications and settings. The mod also requires a lot of disk space and memory to run smoothly.
 
Therefore, the Samargil Remake mod is not a perfect substitute for an official remake or remaster of Need For Speed Underground 2, but rather a fan-made enhancement that adds some new features and improvements to the game. The mod is still a work in progress and may receive further updates and fixes in the future. The mod is recommended for anyone who loves Need For Speed Underground 2 and wants to experience it with a fresh look and feel.
